# pneumonia-detection-cnn
A deep learning project that uses convolutional neural networks (ResNet50 and DenseNet161) to classify chest X-ray images as pneumonia or normal. Includes model training, evaluation, and Class Activation Maps (CAMs) to highlight important regions in the images for better interpretability.
